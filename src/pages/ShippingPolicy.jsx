        JEMINDIAA Industries (“we” “our” and “us”) is the operator of
        (https://jemindiaa.com/) (“Website”), (“you” “they” and “their”) refer
        to the customer who has placed one or more orders or is yet to place an
        order. By placing an order through this Website you will be agreeing to
        the terms below. These are provided to ensure both parties are aware of
        and agree upon this arrangement to mutually protect and set expectations
      </p>

      <Heading as="h2">GENERAL</Heading>

      <p>
        Subject to stock availability. We try to maintain accurate stock counts
        on our website but from time-to-time there may be a stock discrepancy
        and we will not be able to fulfill all your items at time of purchase.
        Some products are stock-based while some products are made-to-order.
        There may not be accurate information on the product page about the
        product being stock-based or made-to-order.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is at our discretion since various dynamic factors are involved in
        this decision so it will change from time to time. For clarification,
        the customer or prospect may contact us via email or phone to understand
        about the product they have ordered or about to order, to avoid any
        misunderstanding or presumption or assumption. In this instance, we will
        fulfill the available products to you, and contact you about whether you
        would prefer to await restocking of the backordered item or if you would
        prefer for us to process a cancellation.
      </p>

      <Heading as="h2">ORDER PROCESSING</Heading>

      <p>
        As mentioned above, the product(s) may already be ready or it may be
        partially produced, or we will only begin to produce or manufacture
        after receiving the order with payment. This varies from product to
        product and/or time to time for the same product
      </p>

      <p>
        The duration of processing / production, from order reception to
        dispatch, is mentioned in each product page. We do not convey, mention
        or promise timeline of delivery, we always communicate in terms of
        dispatch from our end. This duration such as 2-4 days or 7-10 days that
        is written in each product page is written in terms of working days.
        This duration may also vary in actuality depending on circumstances of
        various factors such as material availability, production constraint,
        concerned staff / worker being absent, etc. The duration is to be taken
        only as an approximation.
      </p>

      <p>
        When an order contains more than one product, the longest duration among
        the products ordered is considered to be the approximate dispatch
        timeline. In such cases the products will be sent in one package or in
        multiple packages in one courier booking. We also take the liberty to
        send the products individually if we deem it necessary. We may also send
        a few products first, then remaining products in another package in
        another courier booking, if there are more than two products in a single
        order. Essentially we have multiple approaches to preparing to fulfill
        an order for reasons such as safety of packaging, readiness of
        product(s), etc. The customer is always welcome to communicate with us
        to express his preference of packaging and dispatch. If his request is
        possible for us without any additional cost to bear at our end, we may
        be happy to comply. If additional charges are required, we may collect
        the same from the customer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we are not able to dispatch within the approximate time frame that is
        mentioned in the product page, this will not become a fault of ours
        warranting a cancellation or full refund of the order by the customer.
        As clearly mentioned above, the timelines are approximate. The nature of
        our operations and production process(es) may not allow us to produce or
        package or process a product or order in a fixed time frame. If a
        customer requests cancellation citing such a delay where we may have
        taken more time to dispatch than mentioned in the product page, we may
        not be able to process a full refund, we may be able to refund only up
        to 75% of the order value.
      </p>

      <Heading as="h2">SHIPPING COST - DOMESTICS</Heading>

      <p>
        Free shipping by a courier of our choice (may vary from order to order,
        or product to product of same order ) across India.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who prefer shipping by IndiaPost, an option is given at
        checkout page to switch from free shipping by any courier to IndiaPost
        for an item based fee. This charge will be added to the total price and
        collected from the customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This fee may vary from the actual charge collected by IndiaPost at the
        time of booking the package at their counter because this charge
        includes our service of transporting the package to IndiaPost office and
        our service of booking the package there. In case the actual IndiaPost
        charge is higher than what we have collected from the customer while
        they place the order, we may request the customer to pay an additional
        amount to us.
      </p>

      <Heading as="h2">ORDER FULFILLMENT</Heading>

      <p>
        JEMINDIAA considers an order fulfilled as soon as it is dispatched. The
        tracking number is then shared to the customer, from when the customer
        has the access to track the location / movement, and the right to call
        the customer service of the respective courier company and request
        details or update information / instructions pertaining to the package
        and delivery. The customer is expected to proactively follow up with the
        courier with the tracking number or other means to make sure the
        delivery happens in the right location since the customer would be more
        knowledgeable about the location, address and the availability of
        person(s) at the address to collect the package from the courier
        service. JEM Indiaa will not take responsibility for any mistake in
        delivery since we print the address that the customer has typed while
        placing the order which is passed on to the courier and/or pasted on the
        package.
      </p>

      <p>
        In case of any damage to the package, the customer is expected to not
        accept the same from the delivery person, as the custody then becomes
        that of the customer who will then automatically bear the responsibility
        of the condition of the package. The customer is expected to refuse
        collection of the package if there is any damage so that issue can be
        taken up with the courier service. In such a case, the customer should
        report the same to the courier company and to us with photographic or
        videographic evidence, so that the matter can be taken up to the courier
        company from the customer’s side and perhaps from our side as well to
        seek compensation or resolution for the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the customer collects the package, damaged or not, the package and
        the contents become the sole responsibility of the customer. If the
        customer refuses to take delivery of the package for reasons other than
        physical damage accompanied with proof by photo or video, then it
        becomes a situation between the customer and the courier company where
        we can’t get involved. In case of damage with proof, as mentioned above,
        we may help the customer by raising a complaint or such with the courier
        company as a goodwill gesture.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an order gets stuck, sent back or even lost during the delivery
        process, we may not be able to help as the courier service is out of our
        control. We will try to help recover the package or compensation from
        the courier company.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the parcel has been delivered without you being present to collect,
        and if you are not sure where the parcel is located or if it is missing,
        please contact customer service of the courier company for a solution
        and also let us know, we will find ways to help.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some cases, the courier company may call and request the customer to
        travel to the courier office to pick up the parcel. This usually happens
        in remote areas. The customer may have to understand and do the needful.
        The customer is free to negotiate with the courier company in such
        situations where they may meet in between the route and complete the
        delivery. All this is between the customer and the courier company,
        JEMNDIAA industries is not responsible or liable if the courier company
        is unable to deliver the package at the doorstep of the customer.
      </p>

      <Heading as="h2">Transit time – Domestic orders</Heading>

      <p>
        Generally, it takes anywhere from 1 day to 10 days or more for orders to
        be delivered by the courier companies. The main factor would be the
        distance of the destination from Coimbatore where the packages get
        dispatched. For a better understanding of the time frame from dispatch
        to delivery, please talk to the customer care of the courier company
        after you receive the tracking details from us, or if you wish to know
        the timeline before you place the order or after you have placed the
        order and dispatch is pending, you can contact us via email and our team
        would be able to provide you with an approximate timeline.
      </p>

      <Heading as="h2">Transit time – International orders</Heading>

      <p>
        Generally, orders shipped internationally are in transit for 11 – 15
        days. This timeline may become longer due to various international
        affairs which are not in our control. We do our best to ensure that the
        courier service accepts the booking of the package after confirming that
        they can transport and deliver by themselves or by using third party
        services from at their end.
      </p>

      <p>
        We offer international shipping to the countries listed below. If your
        country is not mentioned, please email us the details of what you would
        like to order and to which country, we will talk to one or more courier
        companies and confirm to you whether we can ship or not. Please note
        that your country could be listed here and order could be placed on our
        website but then we may not be able to dispatch your order if the
        courier company does not accept booking as by that time there may be any
        change in the countries they can service or no longer do. In that case,
        we will do our best to send the package through another courier by
        collecting additional cost from the customer (if required) or process a
        cancellation of the order.
